COMPILE:
execute "make" or:

g++ -c mesh-loader.cpp
g++ -c main.cpp

RUN:
./a.out [mesh_object_file.obj="./obj/spaceship.obj"]

USAGE:

SELECT: Click on a polygon of the mesh. Selected polygon is colored red.

ROTATE: Click anywhere on the wire sphere and drag.

DELETE: Click 'd' to delete the selected surface.

TRIANGLES: Click 't' to split all faces into triangles. Additionally,
           click 'x' to split only the currently selected surface.

SUBDIVISION: Click 's' to split all triangles (if the mesh is not
             an all-triangle mesh, the operations equivalent to
             pressing 't' is performed first) into four (4) new 
             and adjust the vertices to smooth the surface.

NORMALS MODE: Click 'n' to switch between per-surface and per-vertex
              normals.
